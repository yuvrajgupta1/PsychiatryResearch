My aunt takes it for her fear of flying, and she says it really helps.\n\nDoctor: While diazepam can sometimes be used for anxiety, it's not a long-term solution for phobias like yours. It can be addictive, and it doesn't address the root cause of your fear.  It would only mask the symptoms temporarily.  A more effective approach would involve directly tackling your fear of spiders.\n\nSarah:  What do you mean?\n\nDoctor:  I'm thinking about a treatment called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. It's a talking therapy specifically designed to help people manage phobias and anxieties. It teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors all connect, and provides practical tools for managing anxiety responses. In your case, we could gradually introduce you to spiders in a safe, controlled environment.\n\nSarah:  That sounds…terrifying.\n\nDoctor:  I understand your apprehension, but we’d take it very slowly, at your pace. The goal wouldn’t be to make you love spiders, but to manage your reaction to them, so they don’t control your life anymore.

There are times he has a feeling that everything around him is a repeat but at other times even familiar people and features completely baffle him. After some minutes he is himself again but is often slightly disorientated and is often told that he has behaved rather oddly, for example, repeating automatic actions such as lip smacking.

These episodes are increasing in frequency and his behaviour is becoming more strange during them, which is the reason for seeking help now. Another feature that has worried him is that recently he has experienced auditory hallucinations. The hallucination does not last long, but is frightening. He has now become aware that the metallic taste and auditory hallucination precede the episodes and behaviours he cannot remember.

Sometimes it feels like everything is repeating, like I’ve already lived this moment.  Other times, familiar things seem utterly strange, like I don’t recognize them at all.\n\nDoctor: And afterwards?\n\nPatient: Afterwards, I'm sort of… dazed. Confused.

Given your description of the metallic taste, the altered perceptions, the memory loss, and the repetitive movements,  it’s important to rule out some neurological causes. I’d like to refer you for an EEG and an MRI scan. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's happening.\n\nPatient:  What… what kinds of things could it be?\n\nDoctor: It’s too early to say for certain.  We need to gather more information.  But one possibility we want to explore is temporal lobe epilepsy, a type of seizure disorder. The tests will help us determine if that’s the case, or if something else is going on.\n\nPatient: Epilepsy?  But I don't have convulsions.\n\nDoctor:  Not all seizures involve the dramatic movements we often associate with epilepsy.  Some, particularly those originating in the temporal lobe, can manifest with the symptoms you’ve described.

He sees this other patient first in another consultation suite and returns in order to give more time for the discussion. The woman is in tears when he returns and describes that she loves her husband but that he is very possessive of her, and has never been happy for her to go anywhere without him. He works on a computer during the day at a large insurance firm. Despite having trained at college in Child Care she is not currently working, mainly because her husband made it clear when they married that he wanted to be the main breadwinner and did not wish for her to work. He likes to stay in and watch television, and will usually drink a few cans of lager three or four nights a week. He does not usually drink to excess. She stopped her hobbies such as salsa lessons and going out with friends when they started seeing each other, about 3 months before they got married. He used to accuse her of flirting if he ever saw her laughing or smiling with any other man and she began to restrict who she spoke to as a means of avoiding this. She explains that about 6 months ago her best friend, whom he never really liked, began encouraging her to go out with a group of four old school friends who meet at a line dancing group and go for a drink and meal afterwards. Her husband was not keen, but let her go. When she returned he was very suspicious and asked her numerous questions about what she had been doing and whether she spoke to any other men. She considered not going any more, but with the support of her best friend and mother, decided that she was doing no harm and that he may get used to the idea. She went on four more occasions. On each occasion when she returned he insisted on examining her underwear and was aggressive and abusive, calling her offensive names. After the most recent occasion he threw the contents of all her drawers around the bedroom and forced her onto the bed, shouting in her face. She says she has never thought of involving the police. She does not know what to do, because she feels that if she never goes out she will feel trapped, but she cannot cope with his levels of suspicion and hostility.

Then, just as suddenly as it started, it disappeared.\n\nDoctor: And before that, you experienced chest pain and difficulty swallowing?\n\nPatient:  Yes, that was years ago. Again, lots of tests, but everything came back normal.  It eventually went away on its own.\n\nDoctor:  And you’ve managed irritable bowel syndrome since you were 16.\n\nPatient: Yes.  That's… well, that’s manageable most of the time. This pelvic pain is different.  It's constant.  Worrying.\n\nDoctor:  It's understandable that you’re worried.  Given the history of various unexplained pains,  I’d like to explore the possibility that this might be related to something other than a physical problem in the area you experience the pain.\n\nPatient: What do you mean?  Like… in my head?\n\nDoctor: Not exactly “in your head,\" but perhaps the way your body is processing pain signals.  There's a condition called somatic symptom disorder, where physical symptoms, like pain,  cause significant distress and disruption to your life, even when there’s no clear underlying physical cause. It's not that the pain isn’t real – it absolutely is – but the origin might be different than we initially suspected.\n\nPatient:  So, you think… it’s all in my mind?\n\nDoctor:  No, not at all. The pain is very real. But sometimes emotional distress can manifest as physical symptoms. I’m not dismissing your pain.  I'm trying to understand the full picture.\n\nPatient:  So what… what happens now?\n\nDoctor:  I'd like to refer you to a specialist who can assess you for somatic symptom disorder. They can offer therapies, like CBT, that can help you manage the pain and improve your quality of life. Would you be open to that?\n"} ] }]}

This is a common symptom of depression, which is understandable given the trauma you’ve experienced.  You also mentioned feeling guilty when you experience moments of joy.

Given your symptoms – the difficulty concentrating, low mood, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, increased alcohol consumption, and anhedonia – I'm concerned that you may be experiencing depression.  I'd like to discuss some treatment options with you. We could consider therapy, specifically grief counseling, which can provide a safe space for you to process your emotions and develop coping mechanisms. We can also discuss medication if you're open to it.\n\nPatient:  I… I don’t know.  I just want to feel better.\n\nDoctor: I understand.

I feel guilty, they're my grandkids... but I just can’t.\n\n**Doctor:** It’s understandable that you feel guilty, but it’s also important to acknowledge how you’re feeling. You mentioned you’re usually a “go-getter”. This change in your behavior, combined with the fatigue and lack of interest, suggests we need to explore whether something else might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n**Patient:** Like what?  I just want this pain to go away.\n\n**Doctor:**  Well, the pain you're describing, along with the fatigue, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, and loss of interest in things you normally enjoy, could be indicative of depression.  The fact that you’re preoccupied with the pain and find it hard to function at work also points in that direction.\n\n**Patient:** Depression?  But I’m not sad…  I’m just… tired.\n\n**Doctor:**  Depression can manifest in different ways.  Sadness is certainly a common symptom, but it can also present as fatigue, irritability, loss of interest, sleep problems, and changes in appetite.  It's important to remember that feeling tired and unmotivated for an extended period isn't normal.\n\n**Patient:**  (Quietly) I guess… I haven’t really felt like myself for a while. Food tastes like nothing, and even though I’ve lost weight, I don't feel good about it. I just feel… numb.\n\n**Doctor:**  I hear that.  It’s important to address these feelings.  We can discuss some options for treatment, including therapy and possibly medication.  Would you be open to exploring those options?\n\n**Patient:**  I… I don’t know. I just want to feel normal again.\n\n**Doctor:** I understand.  And taking this first step by acknowledging how you’re feeling is a big one.  We can work together to find a treatment plan that’s right for you. We can also refer you to a specialist for your back pain to make sure there isn't a separate physical issue contributing to your discomfort.  How does that sound?\n\n**Patient:** Okay… I guess I'm willing to try."} ] }]}

I know we've been discussing your diabetes management, and I understand your frustration.\n\n**Patient:**  It’s just not working, doctor.  I’m doing everything you told me, but my numbers are still high. I really think I need to see you more often, maybe weekly?  I don't feel the other staff understand my situation the way you do.\n\n**Doctor:** I appreciate you saying that, but I'm concerned that more frequent appointments with me might not be the most effective solution for managing your diabetes. The advice remains the same, and we have a whole team here who are equipped to support you.\n\n**Patient:** But you're the only one who *gets* it. I just can’t seem to get my blood sugar under control, and I feel like I’m failing.\n\n**Doctor:** I understand you feel that way, but I want to reassure you that you're not failing. Managing a chronic condition like diabetes can be challenging.  We've talked about your husband's health issues, and it sounds like that’s adding another layer of difficulty. It must be hard feeling like you’re dealing with this largely on your own.\n\n**Patient:** It is. He’s so focused on his own problems, he doesn’t seem to have any energy left for me.  It’s like… (pauses, voice wavering) …like when my dad left. I was just a kid, and he just… disappeared.\n\n**Doctor:**  That must have been a very difficult experience. Feeling unsupported and let down, like you did then and perhaps like you’re feeling now, can have a significant impact.\n\n**Patient:**  (Nods)  I just… I need someone to rely on. Someone who understands.\n\n**Doctor:**  I understand you’re looking for support, and I’m here to help you manage your diabetes.  However, relying solely on one person can sometimes be challenging for both parties.  I’m wondering if exploring other avenues of support might be beneficial.  Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor? They could provide a safe and confidential space to discuss your feelings and develop coping strategies.\n\n**Patient:**  Therapy?  I don’t think I need therapy.  I just need help with my diabetes.\n\n**Doctor:**  Managing a chronic illness often involves addressing both the physical and emotional aspects.  Therapy isn't about fixing you; it's about providing tools and support to navigate difficult situations and develop healthier coping mechanisms.  It could also help you manage the stress related to your husband’s health and perhaps even improve communication between you two.\n\n**Patient:**  I… I’ll think about it.\n\n**Doctor:** That’s good. It’s important to remember that managing your diabetes effectively involves a team effort.  We are here to support you with your medical needs, but addressing the emotional challenges you're facing might be a crucial piece of the puzzle.

Given your young age and the rapid onset of these symptoms, I’d like to run some additional tests, including some blood work and possibly a brain scan.\n\n**Patient:** A brain scan?

The changes in sound and body image you’re describing could be the aura preceding the headache.\n\n**Patient:**  Aura?  What’s that?\n\n**Doctor:** An aura is a sensory disturbance that can occur before a migraine. It can involve visual changes, like shimmering or flashing lights, but it can also affect other senses, like hearing or even touch.  Your experience of sounds fluctuating and your body feeling like it's changing shape could be examples of that.\n\n**Patient:**  So, it’s not… something more serious?\n\n**Doctor:** While we can’t rule out anything definitively without further investigation, migraine with aura is the most likely explanation based on your symptoms and family history.

We should also discuss your alcohol consumption. While moderate alcohol use isn’t necessarily a problem, excessive drinking can trigger migraines in some people.\n\n**Patient:** Okay.

I’d rather just drive down to see my sister in Cornwall.\n\n**Doctor:**  I understand this feels overwhelming. Instead of a sick note, I’d like to discuss some other options.  We can explore therapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or medication that might help manage your anxiety long-term. This could help you not just with this presentation, but with managing anxiety in other areas of your life, like dating and social interactions.  Would you be open to exploring these possibilities?\n\n**Patient:**  I… I suppose so. It’s just hard to imagine ever being comfortable speaking in public.\n\n**Doctor:** I understand. It’s a process, and it takes time and work, but it’s definitely achievable.  Let's talk about those options now.\n"} ] }]}

I understand you’ve been experiencing some difficulties lately. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?\n\n**Patient:** Well, for the past six months or so, I’ve developed these… rituals.  Checking things.  I have to check the locks, the taps, the light switches, over and over again before I can leave the house.\n\n**Doctor:**  Can you give me an example?  What happens if you don’t check?\n\n**Patient:**  I get this overwhelming sense of dread, like something terrible will happen if I don’t make sure everything is off or locked.  Then I have to go back and check again, and sometimes again after that.\n\n**Doctor:**  How long do these checking rituals typically take?\n\n**Patient:** It’s been getting worse.  Lately, it can take me an hour or more just to leave the house. I'm often late for work now.\n\n**Doctor:** And you're concerned about the impact this is having on your work?\n\n**Patient:** Very.  There have been redundancies lately, and I'm worried I’ll be next if I keep showing up late.\n\n\n**Doctor:** It sounds like you’re experiencing obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  The checking rituals you describe are compulsions, and the anxiety you feel when you don’t perform them are obsessions. It’s important to address this now, especially given the impact it’s having on your work and daily life.\n\n**Patient:** So, what’s wrong with me? Is it something serious?\n\n**Doctor:**  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common anxiety disorder.  It’s treatable, and there are several options that don't involve medication, which you mentioned you’d prefer to avoid.\n\n**Patient:**  What kind of options are there?\n\n**Doctor:**  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for OCD.  It helps you identify and challenge the thoughts and beliefs driving your compulsions.  A specific type of CBT called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is often used, where you gradually expose yourself to the things that trigger your anxiety and learn to resist the urge to perform the rituals.  We can also explore mindfulness techniques and relaxation exercises.\n\n**Patient:** So, I could learn to manage these… rituals without medication?\n\n**Doctor:** Yes, absolutely.  It takes time and effort, but with the right support and strategies, you can learn to manage your OCD and regain control of your life.  Would you be interested in learning more about these non-medication treatment options?\n"} ] }]}

I thought I could handle this on my own.\n\n**Doctor:**  Many people feel that way, but getting support can be incredibly helpful.  It’s not a sign of weakness.

It’s a huge relief.\n\n**Doctor:** That's excellent news. I’m glad to hear the olanzapine is effectively managing your symptoms. That's the most important thing right now. Are you experiencing any other difficulties?\n\n**Patient:** Well, yes. I've gained quite a bit of weight since I started the medication. Almost 6 kilograms. It’s really upsetting.\n\n**Doctor:** I understand your concern. Weight gain is a common side effect of olanzapine.  We can definitely discuss strategies to manage it.  Before we do that, can you tell me a bit about your diet and lifestyle since your discharge?\n\n**Patient:**  Honestly, my motivation has been very low. I’m still not exercising like I used to.  And… I’ve been comfort eating a bit, I guess.\n\n**Doctor:**  And what about smoking and drinking?\n\n**Patient:** I’m still smoking, but I switched to rolling my own cigarettes.  I probably go through about 100g of tobacco a week. I also drink maybe two bottles of wine per week.\n\n**Doctor:** Okay.  So, we have a few areas we can focus on to help manage your weight. While medication can sometimes contribute to weight gain, lifestyle factors play a big role as well. We definitely don’t want you to stop the medication as it’s effectively controlling your symptoms. \n\n**Patient:**  No, I definitely don’t want to go back to how I was feeling before.\n\n**Doctor:**  Exactly.  So, let’s look at making some gradual, sustainable changes.  First, we can discuss some healthier dietary choices and portion control. A registered dietitian could be a great resource for personalized guidance.  Second, incorporating regular exercise, even starting with short walks, can make a difference.  Even a little bit can help improve both your mood and metabolism. We’ll take it at your pace.\n\n**Patient:**  I used to enjoy running before… Maybe I could try that again.\n\n**Doctor:** That’s a great idea. Start slow and gradually increase your distance. Finally, we could discuss smoking cessation programs.  Quitting smoking not only benefits your overall health but can sometimes reduce the tendency to overeat. How do these options sound to you?\n\n**Patient:**  It sounds like a lot, but… I'm willing to try.  I really want to get this weight under control.\n\n**Doctor:**  It’s excellent that you’re motivated to make these changes. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s realistic and achievable for you. I’ll also check your blood pressure and discuss metabolic issues sometimes seen in Schizophrenia at this appointment today and in any future reviews.  We can also consider adjusting your medication if necessary, but for now, the focus should be on lifestyle adjustments given the successful control of your symptoms.  Let’s start by discussing a referral to a dietitian and some realistic exercise goals for the next week.\n"} ] }]}

Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**Patient:**  It's a constant discomfort in my upper abdomen, right here, (gestures) for the past two months.  I also feel bloated and gassy.\n\n**Doctor:**  And this pain, is it related to eating certain foods?\n\n**Patient:** No, it’s there all the time.\n\n**Doctor:** I see.  You mentioned having your gallbladder removed a year ago. Was the pain similar before the surgery?\n\n**Patient:** Yes, it was the same type of pain. I had the surgery hoping it would help, but it hasn't made much difference.\n\n\n**Doctor:**  I also see from your records that you’ve experienced chronic back pain for the past six years and bilateral knee pain as well.\n\n**Patient:** Yes, that's right. I’ve had MRIs and seen specialists, but nothing seems to help the back pain. The knee pain comes and goes. And its  exhausting having the abdominal  problem now adding in to the other longer term problem with pain and fatigue it gives little chance of respite even to start finding any form of relief nevermind start working towards feeling good\n\n**Doctor:** And how has all this pain  affected your daily life energy levels your life overall? It mentions in you notes also some difficulties holding down a regular job also and with personal relationship difficulties. How are you feeling mood-wise considering the level and duration of all the cumulative physical difficulties discussed thus far\n\n**Patient:** It makes most aspects difficult. I’m always tired I’m constantly getting headaches , so have very low motivation or concentration. I  try, so not  working or being able to properly take care of myself makes life feel meaningless, frustrating . Its hard going, especially with raising two kids while receiving welfare, as  I just want some freedom back even if just by having gainful  employment again would do a whole world of difference if i could find a job but its exhausting even going about job-seeking tasks.. Having so much to endure at my age . \n\n**Doctor:** I know things must feel especially hopeless having dealt with many healthcare professionals and lots of diagnostic and also physical treatments without discovering definitive underlying cause thus far and enduring also what must appear unrelenting duration without noticeable  lasting improvement  So given multiple disparate pain origins coupled  with enduring constant daily pain experience it does lend to believe mental heath might need assessing  Its reasonable to consider the physical pains might be indicative or related to psychological factors . especially having noted your recent loss of relationships where history included elements of traumatic or emotionally difficult experiences coupled with constant daily challenges related with managing  household within environment of socio-economic poverty are certainly factors known  to heavily exacerbate ongoing suffering\n\nWe are starting to  see a link between prolonged multiple occurrences from multiple  locations or regions of physical pain might sometimes manifest   because of psychological and emotional distress even if there are objective verifiable findings, such as a ruptured ligaments say on a knee scan might explain or relate some particular sensations yet  cannot fully account for total spectrum so if we have a person for instance who has had previous medical care from many  other therapists or  physicians it helps guide investigations efficiently so its important not retracing that ground. Your previous practitioners have excluded many of the usual physiological and disease models that usually explain and might cure pain.  That itself starts helping towards clearer insights which guides my next  stage thinking\nTo confirm my provisional  understanding. the  next step in this investigative or diagnostic approach are more blood work analysis. Also lets schedule appointments in outpatients' mental health, that way it will  involve some form of therapeutic interventional trials such a say  counseling, alongside, mental and emotional wellness and resilience building  skills via techniques such as cognitive behaviour therapy . Aswell  as some dietary evaluation , as it is stated in you case notes of a lack of healthy foods which obviously impacts on physical overall state. . \n\n\n**Patient:**  Ok that is something that i'd be willing to consider pursuing if nothing other treatments from many other previous interventions has improved symptoms even just a little\n\n**Doctor:** One last and most critical aspect is a safety net regarding thoughts or feelings of suicide and if indeed these thought were present. do have any present mechanism to act in response and also level of ongoing feelings toward action plans if present please express the at this stage.  And that  can allow creating support mechanism during this transitional phase whilst embarking this investigative procedure and also start helping your journey returning towards higher self of wellbeing\n\n**Patient** Never crossed my mind.\n\n\n\n**Doctor**Excellent good stuff. so  I’ll start making the referrals so today lets see if I can get bloods analyzed .   Can next week  suit starting these counseling and psychological assessments with appropriate healthcare practitioner for CBT\n\n\n\n\n"}]} ]}
